# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
Enhance the visual appearance of the Torba text storage application with animations, transitions, and modern UI effects following shadcn UI principles.

Multiple paragraphs outlining the scope, context, and high-level approach. This implementation will transform the current functional but basic UI into a visually engaging experience with smooth animations, transitions, and visual effects. The changes will include entrance animations, hover effects, loading transitions, and modern UI patterns while maintaining the existing functionality. The approach follows shadcn UI design principles with a focus on user experience and visual appeal.

[Types]
Define enhanced component props and animation configurations.

Detailed type definitions, interfaces, enums, or data structures with complete specifications. Include field names, types, validation rules, and relationships.
```javascript
// Animation variants for framer-motion
type AnimationVariant = "fadeIn" | "slideIn" | "stagger" | "bounce" | "scale";

// Card animation configuration
interface CardAnimationConfig {
  initial: { opacity: number; y: number };
  animate: { opacity: number; y: number };
  transition: { duration: number; ease: string };
}

// Text entry with animation state
interface AnimatedTextEntry {
 id: number;
  content: string;
  created_at: string;
  animationKey: string; // For key-based re-rendering with animations
}
```

[Files]
Create and modify UI components to include animations and visual effects.

Detailed breakdown:
- New files to be created (with full paths and purpose):
  - `lib/animations.js`: Animation utilities and variants for framer-motion
  - `components/ui/animated-card.jsx`: Enhanced card component with animations
  - `components/ui/animated-button.jsx`: Enhanced button with hover and click animations
  - `components/ui/animated-textarea.jsx`: Enhanced textarea with focus animations
  - `components/ui/animated-skeleton.jsx`: Enhanced skeleton with improved animations
  - `components/ui/fade-in.jsx`: Wrapper component for fade-in animations
  - `components/ui/slide-in.jsx`: Wrapper component for slide-in animations
  - `components/ui/animated-badge.jsx`: Animated badge component for tags
  - `components/ui/animated-popover.jsx`: Enhanced popover with animations
 - `components/ui/animated-tooltip.jsx`: Enhanced tooltip with animations

- Existing files to be modified (with specific changes):
  - `app/page.js`: Implement animations for form, text entries, and loading states
  - `app/globals.css`: Add custom animation utilities and enhanced styling
  - `components/ui/card.jsx`: Enhance with animation capabilities
  - `components/ui/button.jsx`: Add hover, focus, and click animations
  - `components/ui/textarea.jsx`: Add focus and interaction animations
  - `components/ui/skeleton.jsx`: Enhance with better animation effects

[Functions]
Add animation-related functions and enhance existing functions with animation support.

Detailed breakdown:
- New functions (name, signature, file path, purpose):
  - `lib/animations.js`: 
    - `createStaggerAnimation(delay: number, duration: number)`: Creates staggered animations
    - `createSlideInAnimation(direction: "left"|"right"|"up"|"down")`: Creates directional slide animations
    - `createFadeInAnimation(duration: number)`: Creates fade-in animations
    - `createScaleAnimation(scale: number)`: Creates scale animations
  - `lib/utils.js`:
    - `generateAnimationKey()`: Generates unique keys for animation re-renders

- Modified functions (exact name, current file path, required changes):
  - `app/page.js`:
    - `handleSubmit`: Add success/error feedback animations
    - `Home` component: Implement animated rendering of text entries

[Classes]
Enhance existing components with animation capabilities.

Detailed breakdown:
- New classes (name, file path, key methods, inheritance):
  - `AnimatedCard` (`components/ui/animated-card.jsx`): Card with entrance animations
  - `AnimatedButton` (`components/ui/animated-button.jsx`): Button with motion effects
  - `AnimatedTextarea` (`components/ui/animated-textarea.jsx`): Textarea with focus animations

- Modified classes (exact name, file path, specific modifications):
  - `Card` (`components/ui/card.jsx`): Add animation support
  - `Button` (`components/ui/button.jsx`): Add motion capabilities

[Dependencies]
Add animation libraries and update existing dependencies.

Details of new packages, version changes, and integration requirements.
- New packages:
  - `framer-motion`: For advanced animations and motion effects
  - `react-intersection-observer`: For scroll-triggered animations
 - `lucide-react`: Already installed, will use more icons for visual enhancements
- Version updates:
  - Keep existing dependencies but ensure compatibility with new animation libraries

[Testing]
Add tests for animation behavior and visual feedback.

Test file requirements, existing test modifications, and validation strategies.
- Animation behavior tests for component entrance and exit
- Visual feedback tests for user interactions
- Performance tests to ensure animations don't impact usability
- Accessibility tests to ensure animations can be reduced for users with preferences

[Implementation Order]
Sequential implementation of animations starting with foundational components.

Numbered steps showing the logical order of changes to minimize conflicts and ensure successful integration.
1. Install and configure animation dependencies (framer-motion)
2. Create animation utility functions in `lib/animations.js`
3. Enhance base UI components with animation capabilities
4. Update global CSS with animation utilities
5. Implement animations in the main page component
6. Add advanced animations like staggered lists and hover effects
7. Test and optimize animation performance
8. Add accessibility considerations for reduced motion
